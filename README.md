Fennec
======

A 42 School Norm audit software. Maybe more.

Usage
-----

Just use the fennec executable script at the root of the fennec folder.
(If needed, add the execute rights)

    >$ chmod +x wake-fennec.py
    >$ ./wake-fennec.py [filename/directory...]

And voilÃ  !

Fennec will output the important warnings directly on the console but will
also generate a trace file for further reference.

To clean up the log files and traces, use the `--clean` command:

    >$ ./wake-fennec.py --clean

Enjoy !
