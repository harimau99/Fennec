Fennec
======

A 42 School Norm audit software. Maybe more.

Usage
-----

Just use the fennec executable script at the root of the fennec folder.
(If needed, add the execute rights)

    >$ chmod +x fennec.py
    >$ ./fennec.py filename directory

And voil√† !

Fennec will output the important warnings direcly on the console but will
also generate a trace file for further reference.

Enjoy !
